# Reflection Questions

## 1. What is the advantage of writing tests before writing code?

So we have a clear idea of what our code must output, and set this clear guideline before we start constructing any code. This can keep us on track and remind us of our requirements.

## 2. How did pytest make it easy to verify your functions work correctly?

Pytest is really fast and gives us detailed information about our tests, such as if they passed, and why not. Pytest automatically finds test files and functions and runs them for us.

## 3. Why is it useful to test multiple scenarios for each function?

This is to ensure that our function behaves exactly as we want it to. This is especially helpful for testing edge-cases.

## 4. What happened when you ran tests before implementing the functions?

We got failed test outputs, but this way we made sure our tests were working - they only failed because the functions were undefined, not because of how our test functions were constructed.

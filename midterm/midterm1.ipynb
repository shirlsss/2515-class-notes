    "    - Stage 1: Test Discovery\n",
    "        - Pytest will only run these types of files = `test_*` or `*_test`\n",
    "            - Inside these, will only run functions that match `test_*` naming convention or inside a `Test` class\n",
    "    - Stage 2: Execution\n",
    "        - After collecting, runs each function/method, executed in order they were discovered\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pytest is used for automated testing, for error diagnosis and examination, and helps you catch bugs as you write code -- prevents bugs from reaching end users, and ensures changes don't break functionality\n",
    "    - Therefore, test functions should be constructed before the functions themselves should be written\n",
    "        - Tests should serve as documentation in this stage, to ensure the original function purpose is preserved - keeps us on track\n",
    "        - Enforce discipline, to ensure we write code that meets requirements\n",
    "        - We want different types of tests\n",
    "            1. Red: write a failing test \n",
    "            2. Green: minimal code to make the test pass\n",

    "            \n",

    "- In particular, we are writing unit tests - they should be fast, isolated, repeatable, self-checking, automated tests \n",
    "    1. Arrange      ==>     set up data and condition\n",
    "    2. Act          ==>     execute code being tested\n",
    "    3. `assert`     ==>     verify the result is what we expect\n",
